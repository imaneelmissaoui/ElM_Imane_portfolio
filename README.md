### Imane EL Missaoui  | Health Data scientist |

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of projects and analyses that showcase my skills and experience in data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

## About Me 

I'm a data scientist with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I have experience working with a variety of data sources and tools, including Python, R, SQL. 
I am passionate about data science and eager to continue learning and growing in this field.

### Education
M.S.in Health Management and Engineering-Health Data science at Lille Faculty of Health Management and Engineering(2022-2024)

B.S., Physics and Chemistry at Grenoble Alpes University(2020-2022)

Intensive one/two-year university foundation course preparing for competitive entrance examinations to Engineering schools at Lycée D'Excellence de Benguerir(2017-2019) 

Scientific Baccalaureate, equivalent to High School Diploma specializing in Math and Physics passed with distinction. 

### Work experience

Data scientist apprenticeship @LIP6 
Data scientist intern @Lille Neurosciences and cognition center 


### Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently:

#### Project 1: Uncovering The Topological Features For The Characterisation Of A New Biomarker In Parkinson’s Disease

The objective of this project is to use Topological data analysis to uncover topological features that can help to differentiate the different stages of the Parkinson’s disease progression, but also discriminate between
parkinsonians and healthy individuals. The identification and analysis of these topological features have the potential to characterize a new biomarker that can help in patient prognosis and stratification to improve patient’s selection in clinical trials. You can view the code and analysis for this project in the https://github.com/imaneelmissaoui/Internship-neurodatascience.

#### Project 2: Investigating Maternal Inflammation During Pregnancy and its Association with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Offspring 
Our goal is to create a Knowledge graph using large language models, connecting key aspects from various fields like epidemiology, immunology, and neurobiology, that breaks down the complex
relationship between maternal inflammation and its impact on neurodevelopment by identifying the molecular connections, uncovering causal pathways, and shedding light on possible interventions.
You can view the code and analysis for this project in the https://github.com/imaneelmissaoui/LLMs_and_KGs.

#### Project 3: Polyps Classification and Database design and construction to help diagnose earlier necessary interventions


#### Project 4: Dashboard construction using Dash in python
